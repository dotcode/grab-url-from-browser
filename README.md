grab-url-from-browser
=====================

A little AppleScript to grab the URL from the active tab of your default browser.

Usage
-----
	$ ./grab-url.scpt; pbpaste

How it works
------------
Crudely - there's nothing at all nice about this yet. It simply uses GUI scripting to select and copy the URL to the clipboard.
